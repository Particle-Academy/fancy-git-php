## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- **`Provider\IssueProvider` — issue tracking, as an OPTIONAL capability.**
  `listIssues`, `getIssue`, `createIssue`, `updateIssue`, `commentOnIssue`, with
  a normalized issue shape (id, number, title, state, webUrl, author, labels,
  assignees, timestamps).

  **No action required, and nothing breaks.** It is deliberately a *separate*
  interface rather than five methods added to `GitProvider`: that interface is
  implemented by every provider, including ones outside this package, and adding
  to it would break each of them at load time for a capability many hosts do not
  offer. A self-hosted remote with no tracker is a perfectly good `GitProvider`.

  An adapter opts in, and a caller asks before reaching for it:

  ```php
  if ($provider instanceof IssueProvider) {
      $provider->createIssue($ref, ['title' => 'Broken']);
  }
  ```

  The normalized shape is thinner than any one host's model on purpose. GitHub
  has milestones and state reasons, GitLab has weights and epics, Bitbucket has
  kinds and priorities — none of which survive a move between hosts. What they
  all agree on is normalized; the rest belongs in `extensions`, where a consumer
  that knows its host can reach it without the contract pretending it is
  portable.

  Implemented by `particle-academy/fancy-git-github` 0.2.0. The GitLab and
  Bitbucket adapters do not implement it yet, and `instanceof` reports that
  honestly rather than throwing at call time.
